# Trifunctional macromolecules and their quantum yields


Simulations were run on The Pawsey Centre's Setonix HPE Cray EX supercomputer using the Setonix install of using GROMACS 2023 in conjunction with the GROMOS 54A7 forcefield. 

The mdp input for the production simulations is provided. Folders T0, T1, T3 and T5 contain the topology file for each system, the inital and final frame from each production simulation, and one representative trajectory file. The topology for the solvent, acetonitrile, was downloaded from the Automated Topology Builder (https://atb.uq.edu.au) and is ATB molid: 913062. 

Analysis was performed on trajectory frames spaced at 200 ps intervals. Trajectory visualization, analysis and image rendering were done using VMD version 1.9.4 (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd).
